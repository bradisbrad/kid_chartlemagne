<p>Look folks, I’ve learned how to give a proper preview blurb just in time to spam blog posts all December! I hear those sleigh bells jingling already.

<h1>It’s the most wonderful time of the year</h1>
<p>Advent of Code is something that I came across because someone mentioned it in the Georgia Tech Masters of Analytics slack channel. Oh yeah, quick life update, <strong><em>I was accepted to Georgia Tech’s Masters of Analytics program.</em></strong> Anyway, the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/about">about page of Advent of Code</a> does a better job than I could do of summing up what it is, so here’s their description.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So naturally, instead of using this for any of those things, I’ll be using it for <em>content.</em> My plan, or at least my goal, is to do one post per day of this Advent of Code event, and each day will include all 6 years of this event. For example, Dec. 4th will be the 4th day of this event. I’ll have one Day 4 post that includes the Day 4 puzzle for every year of the event, from 2015 to 2020.</p>
<p>I want to be sure not to spoil anything, so I’ll stay in step with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/index#wiki_how_do_the_daily_megathreads_work.3F">guidelines of the Advent of Code subreddit’s megathread.</a> I don’t anticipate having something ready right when that unlocks (2020’s Day 3 megathread hit the threshold at 4 am EST) but if I <em>do</em> manage to get something together before the threshold of stars earned, I’ll hold off until that thread unlocks.</p>
<p>And, of course, I’m doing all of this in R. I could use this as an opportunity to practice a language I’m less comfortable in, but that’s <em>different content</em> for a <em>later time.</em> I’m going to try to go ahead and speed run the first 3 days of posts and get those out tonight, but in the meantime, if you like what you see from Advent of Code, considering <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/support">tossing them a few bucks</a> or trying it out yourself! The more the merrier here in the merriest season.</p>
