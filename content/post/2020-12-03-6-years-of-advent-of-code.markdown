Look folks, I've learned how to give a proper preview blurb just in time to spam blog posts all December! I hear those sleigh bells jingling already.

# It's the most wonderful time of the year  

Advent of Code is something that I came across because someone mentioned it in the Georgia Tech Masters of Analytics slack channel. Oh yeah, quick life update, **_I was accepted to Georgia Tech's Masters of Analytics program._** Anyway, the [about page of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) does a better job than I could do of summing up what it is, so here's their description.

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

So naturally, instead of using this for any of those things, I'll be using it for _content._ My plan, or at least my goal, is to do one post per day of this Advent of Code event, and each day will include all 6 years of this event. For example, Dec. 4th will be the 4th day of this event. I'll have one Day 4 post that includes the Day 4 puzzle for every year of the event, from 2015 to 2020.  

I want to be sure not to spoil anything, so I'll stay in step with the [guidelines of the Advent of Code subreddit's megathread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/index#wiki_how_do_the_daily_megathreads_work.3F) I don't anticipate having something ready right when that unlocks (2020's Day 3 megathread hit the threshold 4 minutes after it was released) but if I _do_ manage to get something together before the threshold of stars earned, I'll hold off until that thread unlocks.   

And, of course, I'm doing all of this in R. I could use this as an opportunity to practice a language I'm less comfortable in, but that's _different content_ for a _later time._ I'm going to try to go ahead and speed run the first 3 days of posts and get those out tonight, but in the meantime, if you like what you see from Advent of Code, considering [tossing them a few bucks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/support) or trying it out yourself! The more the merrier here in the merriest season.
